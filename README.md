what does this project do?
1. Deploy our vyper contract from raw python
This project teaches you how to:

  Write a Vyper smart contract
  Compile it using Python
  Deploy it to a blockchain (like Sepolia or Anvil) using web3.py
  No frameworks like Brownie or Foundry — pure Python!

So you learn how blockchain actually works “under the hood.”

2. Encrypt our private keys locally, and use then to sign transactions
3. This is going to be reproducible by other engineers using uv with python


what are going to learn?
1. What is a transaction comprised of?
2. what is json keystore?
3. How can I safely store my private keys?
